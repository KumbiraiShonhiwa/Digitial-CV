## 🚀 About

This project serves as my **digital curriculum vitae** — an interactive, web-ready version of my professional resume. It showcases my background as a computer systems engineering student and cyber/software engineer with experience in:

* Full-stack development
* Cyber risk & IT assurance
* Teaching and mentoring
* Software projects and technical artifacts

Being a **digital CV** makes it easier to share my profile with employers, recruiters, and collaborators from anywhere. ([GitHub Docs][1])

## 🧠 Built With

The website is constructed using:

* **Builder.io** – Page builder for content & layout
* **React** and **TypeScript** – Core application framework
* **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first styling
* Modern build tooling (e.g., Vite)

The primary intent is to make the CV **easy to maintain, professional, and extendable**.
